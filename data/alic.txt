Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do.
Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.
So she was considering in her own mind, whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies.
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence. At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
Who are you? said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.
I hardly know, sir, just at present, Alice replied rather shyly. At least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.
What do you mean by that? said the Caterpillar sternly. Explain yourself!
I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir, said Alice, because I'm not myself, you see.
I don't see, said the Caterpillar.
I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly, Alice replied very politely, for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.
